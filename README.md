# Galaxy

Notes on how we're using Galaxy at hidelab.

## Goals

1. Plug Galaxy into GTC (and our other Refinery instances).

2. Create (or revive?) Galaxy workflow for pathprint; and possibly other pipelines.

3. Support teaching and service work that involves Galaxy, on ad advice basis.

Note: We are not intending to support a Galaxy instance for general or group use.
